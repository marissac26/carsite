        <p class="start">  Iron and Steele is the brainchild of <strong>Jake Steele</strong> a car builder, author and automotive historian from Portland, Oregon. Jake is a staple in the hot rod community as a frequent feature writer for Hop Up, Rod and Kulture and in his spare time co-founded <em><strong>The Estranged Car Club</strong></em>. Seeing the need for a web-based community highlighting traditional hot rods, the history of the phenomenon and the people involved, Iron and Steele was born. It is a collaboration of individuals passionate about the greatest hobby on earth: Hot rods. It is meant to cater to not only the die-hard car guys, but also to invite people from all walks of life to see what all the fuss is about through amazing photography and creative story telling</p>

            <p class="start"> This is a story that has a lot to do with new beginnings, life altering occurrences, chance encounters and life long friendships. In very brief terms, it is the epitome of the spirit of Iron and Steele. It was the spring of 2008 and I was living a decent suburban existence. It was your typical scene: 9 to 5 job, 5 to 9 wife, a house and a lot of dreaming about hot rods. It was the kind of thing you would mostly expect from a 26 year old guy with a lot of ideas that were mostly bigger than his means, but I was getting by just fine and even making progress on a Model A coupe that I had bought as just a body a few months before from a local guy I had met through the Jalopy Journal.
